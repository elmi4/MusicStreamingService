- ArtistName -> Artist
- Node contains a ConnectionInfo


---------------------------------------------- High level ----------------------------------------------

- Outer package

- Consumer out of eventdelivery ("κατά την πρώτη επικοινωνία του consumer με το Event Delivery System")

- Different packages for each subclass of Node (?)

- "Production" branch with different .gitignore (?)

- Create xml (?) file to store the paths for the useful dirs like the brokerCredentials.txt and the dir of the songs
 and create ReaderHandler that will use this .xml and interact then with the classes


















 IDEAS________________________________

- If request saveSong() or playData() before having finished retrieving the chunks:
  at the end of the thread execution call a servePendingRequests() that checks if a particular song has been requested
  to be played or saved while it wasn't retrieved fully retrieved
