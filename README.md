### Instructions
- Inside  "*files/Tracks*" there are 2 folders corresponding to the 2 Publishers' data sets. Each Publisher serves 
a set of artists (grouped alphabetically A-M, M-Z). You can add more songs to the application depending on whether the 
artist name of the song belongs to the first or the second data set.

- In order to run the program you first have to start the **1)Brokers**, then the **2)Publishers** 
and then the **3)Consumers** (having specified to the Consumer the artist name and the song name of the song
 you want to request). There are classes with "main" methods inside each of these files.
